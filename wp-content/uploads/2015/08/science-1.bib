In this paper we prove that computing the minimum number of cops that are guaranteed to catch a robber on a given graph is NP-hard and that the parameterized version of the problem is W[2]-hard; the proof extends to the case where the robber moves s time faster than the cops. We show that on split graphs, the problem is polynomially solvable if s = 1 but is NP-hard if s = 2 . We further prove that on graphs of bounded cliquewidth the problem is polynomially solvable for s ≤ 2 . Finally, we show that for planar graphs the minimum number of cops is unbounded if the robber is faster than the cops. "

We show that, for any fixed value of l, the l-coloring problem is polynomial when restricted to graphs of bounded NLC-width (or clique-width), if an expression of the graph is also part of the input. We also prove that the NLC-width of G l is at most 2 ( l + 1 ) nlcw ( G ) . "

abstract = "Abstract Given a vertex-weighted tree T , the split of an edge e in T is the minimum over the weights of the two trees obtained by removing e from T , where the weight of a tree is the sum of weights of its vertices. Given a set of weighted vertices V and a multiset of integers S , we consider the problem of constructing a tree on V whose splits correspond to S . The problem is known to be \{NP\} -complete, even when all vertices have unit weight and the maximum vertex degree of T is required to be at most 4 . We show that • the problem is strongly \{NP\} -complete when T is required to be a path, • the problem is \{NP\} -complete when all vertices have unit weight and the maximum degree of T is required to be at most 3 , and • it remains \{NP\} -complete when all vertices have unit weight and T is required to be a caterpillar with unbounded hair length and maximum degree at most 3 . We also design polynomial time algorithms for • the variant where T is required to be a path and the number of distinct vertex weights is constant, and • the variant where all vertices have unit weight and T has a constant number of leaves. The latter algorithm is not only polynomial when the number of leaves, k , is a constant, but also is a fixed-parameter algorithm for parameter k . Finally, we shortly discuss the problem when the vertex weights are not given but can be freely chosen by an algorithm. The considered problem is related to building libraries of chemical compounds used for drug design and discovery. In these inverse problems, the goal is to generate chemical compounds having desired structural properties, as there is a strong relation between structural invariants of the particles, such as the Wiener index and, less directly, the problem under consideration here, and physico-chemical properties of the substance.

Although this problem does not admit a polynomial kernel for general graphs (unless \{NP\} ⊆ coNP / p o l y ), for planar graphs Guo and Niedermeier [ICALP’08] showed a kernel with at most 14 k vertices, subsequently improved by Wang et al. [MFCS’11] to 4 k . The constant 4 here is so small that a natural question arises: could it be already an optimal value for this problem? In this paper we answer this question in the negative: we show a 11 3 k -vertex kernel for Connected Vertex Cover in planar graphs. We believe that this result will motivate further study in the search for an optimal kernel. In our analysis, we show an extension of a theorem of Nishizeki and Baybars [Takao Nishizeki, Ilker Baybars, Lower bounds on the cardinality of the maximum matchings of planar graphs, Discrete Mathematics 28 (3) (1979) 255–267] which might be of independent interest: every planar graph with n ≥ 3 vertices of degree at least 3 contains a matching of cardinality at least n ≥ 3 / 3 .

abstract = "Efficient algorithms for computing routing tables should take advantage of particular properties arising in large scale networks. Two of them are of special interest: low (logarithmic) diameter and high clustering coefficient. High clustering coefficient implies the existence of few large induced cycles. Considering this fact, we propose here a routing scheme that computes short routes in the class of k -chordal graphs, i.e., graphs with no induced cycles of length more than k . In the class of k -chordal graphs, our routing scheme achieves an additive stretch of at most k − 1 , i.e., for all pairs of nodes, the length of the route never exceeds their distance plus k − 1 . In order to compute the routing tables of any n -node graph with diameter D we propose a distributed algorithm which uses O ( log n ) -bit messages and takes O ( D ) time. The corresponding routing scheme achieves the stretch of k − 1 on k -chordal graphs. We then propose a routing scheme that achieves a better additive stretch of 1 in chordal graphs (notice that chordal graphs are 3-chordal graphs). In this case, distributed computation of routing tables takes O ( min { Δ D , n } ) time, where Δ is the maximum degree of the graph. Our routing schemes use addresses of size log n bits and local memory of size 2 ( d − 1 ) log n bits per node of degree d . "
